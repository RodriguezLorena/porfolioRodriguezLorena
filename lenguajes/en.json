I started in the world of programming in 2021, and that's when I discovered that through technology, I could not only create incredible things, but also help others. I discovered my passion for challenges and problem solving, and since then I haven't stopped learning. I am currently looking for my first IT job, I work as a Full Stack Developer with a focus on FronEnd development.
